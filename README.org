* keepass-mode

** Introduction
This provides an Emacs major mode to open KeePass DB files,
navigate through them, show their entries, and copy the passwords to
the clipboard.

I've been using it for some months without major issues, but the code
is not tested, not very well structured, and should be improved with
CI/CD.

** Requirements
This Emacs mode requires you to have `keepassxc-cli` in your `PATH`.
You can get this program installed by visiting [[https://keepassxc.org/][KeePassXC web page]].

** Install
You just need to clone this repository into your `~/.emacs.d/elpa` as
`keepass-20190830.0001`, and then add the following lines to your
`~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'keepass-mode)
#+END_EXAMPLE
